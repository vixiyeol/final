    <p class="intro">My name's Veronika!</p>
    <p class="intro">I am a UX + Graphic Designer, Photographer, and student.</p>
    <p class="intro">I am passionate about all things creative, technological, and progressive.I am driven by problem solving inside and outside of my professional pursuits, being an avid fan of rock climbing. I love participating in multifaceted projects and activities, connecting fine arts and computer sciences, the great outdoors and fashion.</p>
    <p class="intro">I was was born and spent time in St, Petersburg, Russia, where I discovered my passion for the arts. I focused intently on painting and drawing, and continued to do so after my move to Seattle, Washington,where I dipped my toes in the pool of computer science and coding.Throughout my secondary schooling I discovered the world of digital arts, and with it, the world of graphic design. As I neared the end of my high school education, I was introduced to UX/UI design by my dad, a software engineer, as a way to blend human connection, technological progress, and creative pursuits. </p>
    <p class="intro"> You now find me in my junior year of a BFA in UX/UI design at Lesley University, as I explore the different faces of Graphics and User Experience.</p>
